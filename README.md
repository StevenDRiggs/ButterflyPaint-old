ButterflyPaint is my current WIP.  It is a combination IMS and reference database for artists.  This allows artists to track their favorite color mixing recipes, cross-reference them to what they have in inventory, and decide what colors they can make or what they need to make what they want.  Additionally, they will be able to search the database for color names or recipes using those names.  Final functionality will also include an image search with color-matching/approximating to what is stored, for those asking, "What color is that?"
